"Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://0.0.0.0:5000"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
* start covers.exe
* point your browser to the address shown in the command line

## Usage
### Listen to music
Using Covers and listen to music is very easy. Just click on a album cover art and the tracks of this album will be shown in a modal dialog. Click on a track and it will play. Click another track and this track will be played. Down below in the player you can scrap through the track with the slider or jump to next/previous track with the controls. Also you canjump -/+10 seconds with the forward and backward controls. Clicking the small cover thumbnail will open the album modal dialog again, clicking it again will close it.
The playback plays all title from top to bottom and will stop if it reaches the end of the album.

### Change album cover art
It can happen that the automatic album cover downloader downloads a wrong cover art, but you can change this afterwards. To do this just click on the overview page on an album and then click in the modal dialog the album cover image. Choose another album cover image from your disk and press 'Open'. The album cover will be replaced with the new one and automatically displayed.

## Roadmap

* Spotify integration
* Back cover song chooser (make the back cover interactable to choose the tracks instead of a simple table)
* UI improvements for smaller displays (especially the album modal with track listing)

## Thanks

Special thanks to Stephan for late night discussions about UI related stuff and overall brainstorming.
